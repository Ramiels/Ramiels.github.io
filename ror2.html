				<p>Sort of in the same vein as death mark, though instead of a 1.5x damage multiplier at a flat amount, a bit of crit per debuff.

				<p>This trades in large consistent bonus damage for a chance to re-hit, allowing some hits to burst harder while others will do less. Leans harder into proc builds by causing more hits to proc off.</p>

				<p>Damage is exponential on subsequent re-hits: 80% + 64% + 51% + 41% + 33% etc. Leans into the recursive nature of the spell, and prevents it from becoming far stronger at higher stacks than laser scope as it can roll multiple procs, but doesn't damage up so hard. Has synergy with vrit as vrit doesn't care about damage, and this can effectively multiply its effectiveness while still working with crit effects.</p>
